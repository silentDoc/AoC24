Advent of Code 2024 - Just for fun, to see if I can still code :P

Solutions are not very optimized - I've tried to put the focus on readability and data modeling for better understanding of the solutions

This year I've borrowed from [encse](https://github.com/encse) the idea to add a funny AI image to each day. David Nemeth is an amazing C# dev, which I often compare my solutions in order to improve. Go check his work!
